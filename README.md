# Randy Layne Personal Website

This is the code base for my personal website, redesigned in April 2023 to use React.js and no backend or DB.
It will still to be hosted on AWS, but not using EC2 instances or PostgresSQL RDS. Instead, it will use free
tier of CloudFront and S3 buckets to host. The choice was made in order to cut back on costs of maintaining a
personal site.
